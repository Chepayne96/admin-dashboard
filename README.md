# admin-dashboard

Going to do the basic layout of the page with mock up data. Then when the mock up is correct, I will start with the heading (both sections), then the sidebar, finishing with the body.
Trying to do everything with (grid) maybe some inline for the heading section.

All svg's for the icons are saved in the media folder. Still need to get the profile mockups but that shall wait.

My header is broken into two sections. I figured with the way the search bar and all the icons are out of alignment it would be easiest to seperate them and use inline-block.

The sidebar I think should be pretty straight forward two rows (one for the icons, one for the labels). Thinking about using labels but since they should be clickable might use links instead.

The body will the most work I think with the way the cards are setup and the way the side two cards dont line up with the rest going to add extra columns to get the misaligned look.
